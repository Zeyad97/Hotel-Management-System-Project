# Hotel-Management-System-Project
The Hotel Management System is a university project that has been enhanced to include user authentication, room booking, and an admin panel for managing rooms, employees, and bookings. Built with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL, it helps streamline hotel operations by allowing both users and admins to manage bookings and room details efficiently.
